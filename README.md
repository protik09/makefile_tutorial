# The Definitive Beginners Tutorial to the Unix Makefile

From the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm">TutorialsPoint makefile page</a>:
> Makefile is a program building tool which runs on Unix, Linux, and their flavors. It aids in simplifying building program executables that may need various modules. To determine how the modules need to be compiled or recompiled together, `make` takes the help of user-defined makefiles.

But most tutorials have a pre-requisite that you have either used `make` before or have a good understanding of the rigmarole required to compile and execute programs in a Unix/Linux environment.

This project aims to change that mindset and exists to make this invaluable information available to wider audience with some additional notes for those who are getting their feet wet.
